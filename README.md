# ocp4-upi-compute-powervs

The [`ocp4-upi-compute-powervs` project](https://github.com/ibm/ocp4-upi-compute-powervs) provides Terraform based automation code to help with the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x compute workers on [IBM® Power Systems™ Virtual Server on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/power-virtual-server).

## Prerequisites

1. Requires Terraform v1.5.0 or Higher
2. A PowerVS Service 
3. An RHCOS Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
4. Optional: An RHEL/Centos Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
5. An Existing OpenShift Container Platform Cluster installed on IBMCloud VPC.

## Commands

### Init 

```
❯ terraform init -upgrade
```

### Plan

```
❯ terraform plan -var-file=var.tfvars
```

Note: The PowerVS and IBMCloud VPC regions must be compatible.

### Apply 

```
❯ terraform apply -var-file=var.tfvars
```

### Destroy

```
❯ terraform destroy -var-file=var.tfvars
```

Note, the `destroy` command leaves the Node resource in place, and destroys the virtual server. You must delete the Node manually.

## Cluster Details

There are some important points to mention:

1. The Power Bastion node uses a https proxy to forward requests to the Cluster's internal api load balancer. This setting is configured in /etc/environment on the Power Bastion.
2. NFS is used as the storage provider across nodes.

Is this a Red Hat or IBM supported solution?

No. This is only an early alpha version of multi-architecture compute.
