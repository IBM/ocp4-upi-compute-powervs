# ocp4-upi-compute-powervs

The [`ocp4-upi-compute-powervs` project](https://github.com/ibm/ocp4-upi-compute-powervs) provides Terraform based automation code to help with the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x compute workers on [IBM® Power Systems™ Virtual Server on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/power-virtual-server).

## Prerequisites

1. Requires Terraform v1.4.0 or Higher
2. A PowerVS Service 
3. A PowerVS subnet (`ocp-net`) with L2 network communication open between hosts on the subnet.
4. A PowerVS subnet (`ocp-net-cc`) where the Cloud Connection is going to be setup.
5. An RHCOS Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
6. An RHEL/Centos Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
7. An Existing OpenShift Container Platform Cluster (on Power or Intel VPC)
8. A downloaded ignition file stored (in data folder) using: 
  - `curl -k http://api.demo.ocp-multiarch.xyz:22623/config/worker -o worker.ign -H "Accept: application/vnd.coreos.ignition+json;version=3.2.0"`
  - `oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data --keys=userData --to=-`

## Commands

Is this a Red Hat or IBM supported solution?

No. This is only an early alpha version of multi-architecture compute.
