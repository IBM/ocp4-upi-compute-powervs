# ocp4-upi-compute-powervs

The [`ocp4-upi-compute-powervs` project](https://github.com/ibm/ocp4-upi-compute-powervs) provides Terraform based automation code to help with the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x compute workers on [IBM® Power Systems™ Virtual Server on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/power-virtual-server).

*Warning* Active code updates in progress to make the code base more resilient.

## Prerequisites

1. Requires Terraform v1.5.0 to v1.5.5. You may use the alternative [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/).
2. A PowerVS Workspace on IBM Cloud that supports [Power Edge Router](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-per). If your workspace supports s922,s1022,e980,e1080, you'll have to update the var.tfvars to the supported `system_type`.
3. An RHCOS Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
4. Optional: An CentOS Stream 9 Image loaded to the PowerVS Service
5. An Existing OpenShift Container Platform Cluster installed on IBMCloud VPC with Intel architecture.

## Commands

### Init 

```
❯ terraform init -upgrade
```

### Plan

Copy the `var.tfvars` into a sub-folder data/

Edit for your usage

```
❯ terraform plan -var-file=data/var.tfvars
```

Note: The PowerVS and IBMCloud VPC regions must be compatible.

### Apply 

```
❯ terraform apply -var-file=data/var.tfvars
```

### Destroy

```
❯ terraform destroy -var-file=data/var.tfvars
```

Note, the `destroy` command removes the Node resource, removes the NFS deployment, and destroys the virtual servers. Please backup your NFS Server first - it is destroyed.

## Cluster Details

There are some important points to mention:

1. The Power Bastion node uses a https proxy to forward requests to the Cluster's internal api load balancer. This setting is configured in /etc/environment on the Power Bastion.
2. NFS is used as the storage provider across nodes.

## Running Automation from another IBMCloud VPC

To run the code, you'll need to set the MTU for your machine: 

```
ip link set eth0 mtu 1400
```

### Getting the IPs of Power Workers

To get the IPs of the Power Workers. 

```
❯ oc get nodes -l 'kubernetes.io/arch=ppc64le' -owide
